# Handoff — realtime (WebRTC → WS → s2s-stream → POST), edge sidecar, telemetry — 2026-10-07

Branch `claude/gallant-keller-54sdt9` (built as `realtime-integration`): the three branches `telemetry`,
`realtime-control` and `realtime-edge` merged on top of `main` (`dead-code` was already in `main`, `f3d774e`), then
fixed and proven end to end on one machine. **Not deployed, not run on a GPU.** The PR still has to be opened.

## What is in it

| Area | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Unified telemetry (browser, gateway, edge, model; W3C `traceparent`; scrubber; JSONL store; `/v1/telemetry/*`) | `src/telemetry/`, `sdk/browser/telemetry/`, `docker/aigw-edge/telemetry.py` | merged; realtime events now wired to the store (`serve.ts`) |
| Realtime control plane (admission, session token, signaling relay, WS relay, TURN creds, load report) | `src/realtime/`, `sdk/browser/realtime/` | merged; `maxHeaderSize` 32 KB on the proxy (WS token ~8.3 KB in the URL) |
| Edge sidecar (aiortc + aiohttp, WebRTC + WS, VAD, STT/LLM/TTS streaming, barge-in, limits), cloud-init, coturn profile | `docker/aigw-edge/`, `src/deployments/cloud-init.ts` | merged |
| **Reachability** (new, owner's request): the edge checks its path instead of assuming a public UDP port | `docker/aigw-edge/aigw_edge/netcheck.py`, `src/realtime/net-probe.ts`, `docs/realtime-edge.md` § Reachability | new, proven locally |
| Local end-to-end test | `scripts/realtime-e2e/` | new, 28/28 |

### Reachability — fastest path first, every decision logged

1. **direct** — the gateway sends a UDP echo to the edge's probe port (last port of `RT_UDP_PORTS`); a reply means a
   browser's UDP gets in.
2. **relay** — inbound UDP blocked: the edge allocates on the TURN server **outbound** (UDP, then TCP, then TLS) and
   offers a relay candidate, so WebRTC works with no inbound port open.
3. **ws** — neither: the edge stops listing `webrtc`; admission sends the learner straight to the WebSocket through the
   gateway (the reverse-proxy path, slowest, kept last) — no ~5 s lost on a doomed ICE attempt.

Logs: `rt.net.probe` (gateway, per replica), `edge.net.relay_try`, `edge.net.path` (with the reasons, e.g.
`inbound udp/50140: blocked | relay turn:…?transport=udp: allocated (3 ms)`), and per session `rt.ice.selected` /
`edge.ice.selected` (host or relay on each side, protocol, RTT). Status: `GET /__aigw/rt/status` → `net`.

## Bugs found by the local e2e (unit tests were green on all of them)

1. **WS rung refused after WebRTC** — the SDK tries WebRTC then WS with the one token of its admission; the edge
   treated the second use as a replay (4401). Every learner on a UDP-blocking network would have skipped WS and fallen
   to s2s-stream. Fix: `sid` single use **per transport**; a new session of the same sid supersedes the previous one
   (`token.py`, `server.py`, test in `tests/test_units.py`). Not fixed in the SDK on purpose: a second admission
   would charge the app's budget twice and hold an abandoned slot for 20 s.
2. **Realtime events never reached the telemetry store** — `serve.ts` passed no sink to `createRealtime` (TODO left
   for after both PRs). Now `realtimeSinkToTelemetry` + `sessionResolverFrom`.
3. `realtime-edge.test.ts` assumed the speech-stack default was the L4; `main` moved it to the L40S (16 sessions).

## Proof (this machine, no GPU)

`EDGE_PYTHON=<venv>/bin/python bun scripts/realtime-e2e/e2e.ts` — real gateway (proxy + controller + realtime +
telemetry wired like `serve.ts`), replicas of real nginx front + real edge + fake model, real coturn, iptables for
firewalls, Chromium with the browser SDK. Needs root (iptables), `nginx`, `turnserver`, Bun **≥ 1.4.2** (1.3.x does
not deliver writes on an upgraded `node:http` socket: the WS relay never answers 101 — production pins 1.4.2).

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| admission: 401 no key, 403 other app, 200 with 4 transports | ok |
| WebRTC turn through gateway signaling, NPC audio measured in the page, one trace browser+gateway+edge | connect 2.2 s, first audio 241 ms (edge) / 333 ms (browser) |
| browser UDP blocked → WS through the gateway relay | ok, full turn |
| edge killed mid-session → s2s-stream, history kept | ok |
| capacity → 503 saturated + Retry-After + fallback; cold + no-wake; wake | ok |
| GPU inbound UDP dropped → relay via TURN | connect 2.3 s, first audio 242 ms, edge pair = relay |
| no UDP and no TURN → ws only | connect **0.13 s** (no WebRTC attempt) |

Also green: edge `tests/test_units.py` (25) and `tests/harness.py`; vitest `__tests__/unit/{realtime,telemetry,stt-filter}`
+ `deployments/realtime-edge` (182); `tsc`. The full suite on the merge had 3 failures before the fixes: 2 were real-API
integration tests that also fail on `main` (`fallback-integration`, `load-balancer-integration`), 1 was item 3 above.

## Not done / next

1. **Build and push the `aigw-edge` image** (`ghcr.io/marcosremar/aigw-edge:<tag>`, `DEFAULT_EDGE_IMAGE`). Until it
   exists, do NOT add `"realtime": {}` to `src/deployments/declared/parle-speech.json`: the replica would fail to
   pull the sidecar. Today that file has no `realtime`, so production GPUs come up without the edge.
2. Open the PR from this branch; run `check:land` equivalent (full vitest) once; merge `main` again if it moved.
3. GPU test (docs/realtime.md § End-to-end test plan): real models, public IP, Scaleway security group, TURN over
   TLS/443, barge-in, CPU per session at 16 sessions on the L40S.
4. Admission should refuse a session config without `voice` (today the edge fails mid-turn with `upstream`).
5. Bun logs `Request killed by total timeout` ~6 s after keep-alive requests that already answered (idle socket timer
   of `server.setTimeout`); harmless in the test, worth checking under Bun 1.4.2 in production.
6. The local e2e is not in CI (needs root, nginx, coturn, Chromium); run it by hand before touching the realtime path.
